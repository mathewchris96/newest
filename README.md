# Password Manager

## Introduction

Welcome to the Password Manager, a secure solution for storing and managing your passwords. This application is designed to provide a seamless experience for users looking to keep their credentials safe and easily accessible. It integrates both frontend and backend components to ensure a robust and user-friendly interface.

## Application Context

This Password Manager is part of a broader application suite aimed at enhancing user security and convenience. It leverages modern authentication methods, including Google Sign-In, to provide a secure and efficient user experience.

## Setup and Configuration

### Backend Setup

The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. To set up the backend, ensure you have the following environment variables configured in a `.env` file:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run (default is 5000).
- `DB_CONNECTION_URI`: The MongoDB connection string.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: A secret key for session management.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth client ID.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth client secret.

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
npm install
node password_manager_backend/app.js
```

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application. It requires no additional setup other than ensuring the backend is running and accessible.

To serve the frontend, you can use any static file server. Simply open `password_manager_frontend/index.html` in your browser.

### Google Sign-In Configuration

Ensure that the `client_id` in `password_manager_frontend/script.js` is set to your Google OAuth client ID:

```javascript
gapi.auth2.init({
  client_id: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'
});
```

Replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'` with your actual client ID.

## Frontend and Backend Interaction

The frontend interacts with the backend through a series of API endpoints. The key interactions include:

- **Google Sign-In**: The frontend uses Google Sign-In to authenticate users. The token received is sent to the backend for verification.
- **Registration and Login**: Users can register and log in using their email and password. These actions are handled via POST requests to the backend.
- **Password Management**: Users can save, view, and delete their credentials. The frontend communicates with the backend to perform these CRUD operations.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**: Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and start the backend server.
2. **Open the Frontend**: Use a static file server or open `index.html` directly in your browser.
3. **Authenticate**: Use Google Sign-In or register with an email and password to access the password management features.

## Advanced Configurations

For deployment, consider using services like Heroku or AWS for the backend and Netlify or Vercel for the frontend. Ensure environment variables are securely managed and that the application is configured to handle production-level traffic.

By following these instructions, you should have a fully operational Password Manager that integrates seamlessly with your broader application context.
